Random little thing I'm playing around with.
Trying to get a better understanding of Python in general, and drawing in live data feeds + GIS in particular.

We'll see how this works out.  The project is completely free form, zero planning, and will expand to include random libraries and whatnot as my interests and goals shift about.

Enjoy.
